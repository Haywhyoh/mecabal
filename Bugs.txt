2. The phone number already exists error:
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "Phone number is already registered to another account. Please use a different number.",
    "method": "phone"
}

4. No way to handle incomplete registration for users. since after they cveriy number but they did no setup location,
they can still login and then errors everywhere because they did nto setup neighbor hood~
the can also not register with the same details cos it already exists

5. I need to ab;e to check if an email already exist before sending code.
