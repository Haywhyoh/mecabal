# MeCabal User Service - Master Implementation Plan
**Complete Backend Implementation Roadmap**
*From Zero to Production-Ready*

---

## Executive Summary

This master plan provides a complete roadmap for implementing all missing backend functionality for MeCabal's user-related features. The mobile app has sophisticated UI for user profiles, verification, gamification, and cultural features - but the backend is severely underdeveloped.

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Mobile app: Feature-complete with rich UI
- ‚ùå Backend: User Service is a "Hello World" placeholder
- ‚ùå Backend: No gamification, verification, or cultural systems

### Goal State
- ‚úÖ Fully functional User Service with all profile features
- ‚úÖ Complete verification system with NIN integration
- ‚úÖ Gamification system with achievements and leaderboards
- ‚úÖ Cultural profile system with Nigerian context
- ‚úÖ Business account system (Gap 5 - separate guide)

- Target: 80% coverage

### Integration Tests (Required)
- API endpoint behavior
- Database operations
- File upload functionality
- Authentication flows

### E2E Tests (Recommended)

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ Encrypt NIN numbers at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- ‚úÖ Secure document storage (private S3 buckets)
- ‚úÖ JWT token authentication
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ‚úÖ Input validation with DTOs

### Privacy
- ‚úÖ User-controlled privacy settings
- ‚úÖ GDPR-compliant data deletion
- ‚úÖ Audit trails for verification
- ‚úÖ Anonymization after account deletion

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚úÖ Users can only modify their own data
- ‚úÖ Admin-only verification endpoints
- ‚úÖ Verified-user-only endorsements
