# Updated Marketplace Strategy: Business-Centric Approach

## Overview
This document outlines the updated strategy for the marketplace functionality, focusing on a business-centric approach for services while maintaining individual listings for jobs, properties, and goods.

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### 1. Service Discovery Strategy
**Original**: Individual service listings with hybrid offering/request model
**Updated**: Business-centric approach leveraging existing business infrastructure

### 2. Navigation Strategy
**Original**: Android-specific back button
**Updated**: Universal back button for both iOS and Android

### 3. Data Model Strategy
**Original**: New service-specific entities
**Updated**: Enhance existing Business entity with service offerings

## Updated Architecture

### Service Discovery Flow
```
User searches "Local Businesses"
→ Filters by category (e.g., "Plumbing")
→ Sees business profiles with:
   - Business name and verification level
   - Services offered (multiple services per business)
   - Service area coverage
   - Reviews and ratings
   - Contact preferences
   - Response time expectations
```

### Business Profile Structure
```typescript
interface BusinessProfile {
  id: string;
  businessName: string;
  businessType: string;
  verificationLevel: 'basic' | 'enhanced' | 'premium';
  
  // Multiple services per business
  servicesOffered: {
    category: string;
    subcategory: string;
    description: string;
    pricing: {
      model: 'hourly' | 'project' | 'fixed' | 'negotiable';
      rate?: number;
    };
    availability: {
      days: string[];
      startTime: string;
      endTime: string;
    };
  }[];
  
  // Service coverage area
  serviceArea: {
    type: 'estate' | 'neighborhood' | 'city' | 'state';
    radius?: number;
    specificAreas?: string[];
  };
  
  // Professional credentials
  credentials: {
    licenses: string[];
    certifications: string[];
    experience: number;
    insurance: boolean;
  };
  
  // Contact preferences
  contactPreferences: {
    allowCalls: boolean;
    allowMessages: boolean;
    allowWhatsApp: boolean;
    preferredTime: string;
  };
  
  // Response expectations
  responseTime: number; // in hours
}
```
