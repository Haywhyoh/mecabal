# MeCabal Community Post Feature - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the community post feature in the MeCabal Nigerian neighborhood app. The feature enables neighbors to share updates, ask questions, coordinate activities, and build community connections within their estates/compounds.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Post entity with relationships to users, neighborhoods, categories, media, reactions, and comments
- ✅ **Mobile Types**: Basic Post interface defined in mobile app
- ✅ **Backend Service**: Social service skeleton exists but needs implementation
- ✅ **Mobile Data Service**: Basic CRUD operations defined for posts
- ⚠️ **Social Networking**: Rich connection system data models exist but not integrated with posts

### Technical Foundation Review
- **Backend**: NestJS microservices with TypeORM entities
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing for posts
- **Mobile**: React Native with TypeScript, service layer architecture
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with Nigerian context (phone verification)

## Feature Scope & Nigerian Context

### Core Post Types
1. **General Posts** - Community updates, questions, announcements
2. **Event Posts** - Community gatherings, activities, celebrations
3. **Alert Posts** - Safety alerts, emergency notifications, urgent updates
4. **Marketplace Posts** - Buy/sell items, service offerings (integration with marketplace)
5. **Lost & Found Posts** - Missing items, pets, people

### Nigerian-Specific Considerations
- **Estate/Compound Focus**: Posts are neighborhood-scoped to Nigerian housing contexts
- **Trust & Verification**: Integration with verification levels and trust scores
- **Safety First**: Emphasis on safety alerts and community watch features
- **Local Context**: Support for Nigerian languages, cultural references, local time zones
- **Connectivity**: Offline-first approach for unreliable internet connections
