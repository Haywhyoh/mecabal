## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Problem: API calls failing with 401 errors
**Solution:** Ensure auth token is properly set in AsyncStorage and attached to all requests via interceptor.

### Problem: Mock data still appearing
**Solution:** Search for hardcoded arrays and objects. Use global search for "useState<Business" to find mock state.

### Problem: Pagination not working
**Solution:** Check that page number increments correctly and API response includes pagination metadata.

### Problem: Images not loading
**Solution:** Ensure backend returns full image URLs. Use FastImage for better performance.

### Problem: Search returning no results
**Solution:** Verify location permissions granted and coordinates passed correctly to API.
